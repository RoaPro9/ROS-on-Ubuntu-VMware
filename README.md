### What is VMware Workstation pro?
VMware Workstation is a line of Desktop Hypervisor products which lets users run virtual machines, containers and Kubernetes clusters.

### How do VMware Workstation pro work?
VMware Workstation workby using special functions in modern 64-bit x86 CPUs to create fully isolated, secure virtual machines that encapsulate an operating system and its applications. The VMware virtualization layer maps physical hardware resources to a virtual machine's virtual resources, so each virtual machine has its own CPU, memory, disks, and I/O devices, as well as the full equivalent of a standard x86 machine. VMware Workstation installs onto the host operating system and provides broad hardware support by inheriting device support from the host.
